# GrassGrowingSimulator
This project was created for Ludum Dare 41 in order to combine the "incompatible" genres of Grand Strategy and a Cellular Automaton. On 24 April 2021, it was merged with a project from 2015 (which had been forgotten, but was the original inspiration of the project). It will be rewritten from SFML to Ncurses (or lower level ANSI escape sequences).
